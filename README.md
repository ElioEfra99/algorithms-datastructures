## Algorithms and Data Structures
This is where I will keep track of the knowledge acquired in the "Introduction to Algorithms" book from Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest 
and Stein also from a course from Andrei Neagoie in Udemy which mostly expects to prepare to for a coding interview. Uploading 
this for the sake of learning and sharing with people that has the same interests and improve also my skills using Git/Github.

Feel free to download the whole project and make some suggestions I am open for feedback and tips.

I will use Python as main language, if someday I feel like using another language, maybe I will go for Javascript or Java for increasing other programming language knowledge.
